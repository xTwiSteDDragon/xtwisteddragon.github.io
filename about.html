        <p>
          I've been interested in technology and computers ever since I learned how to type on a computer on my own at
          three
          years old.
          I spent a lot of time playing games and watching videos on YouTube when I was younger, and I often expressed
          my
          interest in technology as I went through elementary, middle school, and high school.
        </p>

          What are your interests in Computer Science?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm still exploring where I want to specialize, but as of now I think the topics that interest me are AI,
          Machine
          Learning, Front-End Development, Videogame Development, Cybersecurity, and Software Engineering.
          I'm still learning a lot and it's going to take some time before I gain and understanding of what I like most.

          What do you like to do in your personal time?
        </h1>
        <p>
          When I get time, I love to play video games! To explore worlds where I can create anything; fight monsters and
          take
          part in epic battles;
          laugh with friends for hours and make lasting memories. Always one of my favorite hobbies, for sure. Aside
          from
          this
          though, I gain a lot of joy from painting.
          I love painting miniatures from games such as Warhammer and Dungeons and Dragons, but I also like painting
          miniatures of my favorite video game characters and other cool-looking creatures.
          When I don't feel like gaming or painting, I spend time making or remixing music in Ableton Live, a DAW
          (Digital
          Audio Workstation).
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever I get the chance, I also find a lot of joy in working with computer parts and putting together or
          upgrading
          PCs for myself or my friends.
          Since 2020, when I first got my own high-end PC, I spent a lot of time learning how the parts work together,
          what
          specific function each has in a system, and what's the best to work with these days.

          What are you doing now?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Since August of 2024, I've been a Computer Science student at TCNJ (The College of New Jersey).
          I've spent time in a couple different clubs, such as the Association of Computing Machinery, Association of
          Worlds,
          and Game Design Club.
          I've also been mataining high grades (all A's) so far (yippee!).
          I'm hoping to get into some classes that cover the topics mentioned in my interests, while also creating
          projects
          that are interesting and are out of the norm for CS majors.
          I'm looking to find ways to make Computer Science as fun and interesting as possible, without the tediousness
          that
          comes with it sometimes.

      <p>
        Well, you're looking at my first project right now! It's also possible that you're looking at the newest version
        of
        it, as I hope to update and flesh it out more as I gain experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        I started with this as my first project to practice a bit of coding skills over the Summer of 2025, while also
        keeping it pretty simple and low-key.
        The first few days of the project were spent understanding basic HTML as I created the "Home" page, and the days
        when I decided to continue work I added more pages as you can see in the navigation bar above.
        I never created a stylesheet with Javascript in the past, and I never had experience with HTML or CSS, so this
        was
        quite new for me.
        If you're reading this text, then it means I'm currently hosting the server either through GitHub or some other
        service.
        In any case, whether it draws attention or not, it's meant to be a simple project that dips my toes into
        something
        new, interesting, and exciting as a first project. It also serves as a waypoint to provide short descriptions of
        other projects I've worked on, as well as acting as a 'virtual business card', in a way.
